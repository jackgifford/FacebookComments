There is so much peripheral retina which is essential for orientation, maintaining some form of binocular vision and could be a driver for the further progression of myopia in that eye. At the very least any contact lens would help to balance anisokonia and may make a difference to stimulating the acuity.

VT could make a difference to the amblyopia. It all depends if you can find a potential cause for the amblyopia and/or establish that there is no pathology. It takes some effort from the patient and some don't want to give it a try. 6/48 is dense amblyopia but not insurmountable.,Unknown,0,0,0,,1811481585762285,Myopia Profile

Left eye was 20/20 and doctors sugested a surgery in that eye to prevent same thing happening in that eye. After surgery the 20/20 eye become a 20/80 VA. Started VT and she reached and mantained 20/25 (nothing to do with right eye). But first week of November she went to her eye doctor for her every 6month follow up check and, as in all the previous checks, they did cicloplegia.

What is marginally interesting is not that he has had virtually no change in refraction over the last 5 years with a +0.12 D change in OD and a 0.00 D ""change"" OS, but there were some significant differences in lens design OD and OS which could have impacted myopia progression, but didn't end up making any difference. The design differences were that the OD lenses tended to need much larger distance zone diameters to address glare complaints, at 3.2 mm DZD OD vs 2.5 mm DZD OS along with intermediate zone diameters of 5.4 mm OD and 5.0 mm OS. We also tried smaller total diameter OD to improve centration and over the last year we tried decentered optics in the Optisync design to improve visual performance, which did work. This last year, the zones were the same OU. The first year with different zones appeared to support the theory that larger central zones might be less effective in controlling myopia with changes of +0.13 mm OD and -0.04 mm OS. The next year flipped a bit with OD -0.02 mm and OS +0.05 mm. The next several years were equal at +0.09 mm OU followed by this last year at +0.06 mm OU. So maybe zones matter.

Here’s Xu Cheng (Cathy), Noel Brennan and Mark Bullimore presenting their important work on understanding whether efficacy is relative (a percentage) or absolute - analysing 93 datasets of a variety of treatment vs control revealed the typical trend of efficacy being much higher in the initial year compared to following years. This is why shorter studies frequently show higher % treatment effects. Check out the chart bottom left. This shows trend lines for numerous OrthoK, soft multifocal CLs and bifocal / progressive spectacle treatments. When the big initial response and reduced response in subsequent years is plotted, there’s a pretty clear picture that the treatment appears to plateau out to an absolute effect, of around 0.45mm (in OrthoK) or 1D (bifocal specs). Look how it also shows similarity between the treatments. Then check out the bottom right chart and conclusions. The authors propose that it may not be appropriate to extrapolate something like 50% across many years of potential childhood progression - they’ve coined the term Cumulative Absolute Reduction in axial Elongation; the ‘CARE’ factor! These guys aren’t trying to depress you about the value of myopia control 😋 - simply to ensure an appropriate and evidence based way to understand efficacy. So is it worth it for what could amount to perhaps only 0.45mm or 1D of myopia reduction? The answer is yes! More work by Mark and Noel has shown a reduction in the risk of myopic maculopathy of 40% for each 1D reduction in myopia. Mark presented this at #AAO2018 (search this hashtag for what was a very popular post) and it will soon be published - can’t wait to share it with you all as it’s a clear remit for the ‘why’ of myopia control, right across the refractive range (not just for high myopia).

Katrina Schmid presented our research where we compared these measurements in a single Visio distance CL to the Coopervision Misight concentric add design and continuous aspheric Coopervision Biofinity centre distance +2.50 Add and Visioneering NaturalVue designs. We found that the Misight lens didn’t significantly alter vergence, accommodation or visual quality compared to single vision. Both continuous aspheric designs similarly gave an exophoric shift (around 2 prism dioptres) in near phoria and reduced accommodative response (increased accom lag) by about 0.50D at 33cm. These designs also affected distance and near acuity more than Misight or SV. The image shows a summary of the effects. The clinical relevance? If you don’t want a BV change in selecting a MFCL, the concentric Misight design appears to be your choice. But if you do want an exophoric shift for an eso myope, then the continuous aspheric designs could be better. My poster presentation tomorrow will delve more into the accommodation effects of these lenses and adds in a centre distance +1.50 Add lens for extra comparison.

At one year, the LAMP study showed a dose dependent response, where axial length efficacy was about 50% in 0.05% and a lowly 12% in 0.01%. You can read my summary of the LAMP one year results in this Myopia Profile blog (or just look at the image!): https://myopiaprofile.com/atropine-wonder-or-weak-treatment/#more-3106 After one year, lead author Jason Yam said that the placebo group was changed to 0.05% for ethical reasons - with clear proof of efficacy, it wasn’t ethical to continue a group with no treatment. This is a bummer for the study, but better for those children! At two years, the 0.05% group had progressed -0.55 +/- 0.84D, with twice the progression in the 0.01% group of -1.11 +/- 0.86D. The group who were on placebo for the first year then 0.05% for the second year progressed a total of -0.99D. The take home messages? Over two years, 0.05% appears to have twice the efficacy of 0.01%, and 1 year of 0.05% has similar efficacy to two years of 0.01%. More detail on outcomes with 0.025% and how it compared to the others is in a table in the abstract for you to view. Interestingly, in the 0.01% group, 21% progressed by less than 0.50D / 2 yrs (54% for 0.05%) and 20% progressed by more than 2D / 2 yrs (8% for 0.05%). Great results which confirm that we probably need to reconsider 0.01% as monotherapy, and that we still have lots more to learn about duration, dosage schedule and combo treatment with atropine. https://ativsoftware.com/appinfo.php?page=Inthtml&project=ARVO19&server=eventpilot.us&id=3155505 #ARVO2019",,2019-05-01 20:43:16,Are they planning on doing a washout part to see how fasts they rebound?,Unknown,0,1,0,,1811481585762285,Myopia Profile

At one year, the LAMP study showed a dose dependent response, where axial length efficacy was about 50% in 0.05% and a lowly 12% in 0.01%. You can read my summary of the LAMP one year results in this Myopia Profile blog (or just look at the image!): https://myopiaprofile.com/atropine-wonder-or-weak-treatment/#more-3106 After one year, lead author Jason Yam said that the placebo group was changed to 0.05% for ethical reasons - with clear proof of efficacy, it wasn’t ethical to continue a group with no treatment. This is a bummer for the study, but better for those children! At two years, the 0.05% group had progressed -0.55 +/- 0.84D, with twice the progression in the 0.01% group of -1.11 +/- 0.86D. The group who were on placebo for the first year then 0.05% for the second year progressed a total of -0.99D. The take home messages? Over two years, 0.05% appears to have twice the efficacy of 0.01%, and 1 year of 0.05% has similar efficacy to two years of 0.01%. More detail on outcomes with 0.025% and how it compared to the others is in a table in the abstract for you to view. Interestingly, in the 0.01% group, 21% progressed by less than 0.50D / 2 yrs (54% for 0.05%) and 20% progressed by more than 2D / 2 yrs (8% for 0.05%). Great results which confirm that we probably need to reconsider 0.01% as monotherapy, and that we still have lots more to learn about duration, dosage schedule and combo treatment with atropine. https://ativsoftware.com/appinfo.php?page=Inthtml&project=ARVO19&server=eventpilot.us&id=3155505 #ARVO2019",,2019-05-01 21:45:19,Valery Daviotis Liza Deuel,Unknown,0,0,0,,1811481585762285,Myopia Profile

I have a 15 year old myope who’s rx has changed from R-1.50 L-2.00 to R-2.00 L-2.50 in the last 12 months. Px is a full time sv contact lens wearer. With myopic change & being a current cl wearer I suggested we could change to a Myopia Control Daily disposable lens. His thought is the patient is too old for MC therefore I am over prescribing.
